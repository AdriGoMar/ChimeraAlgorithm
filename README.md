# Chimera Algorithm
The Chimera Algorithm is a CNN architecture optimizer using a mixture of Artificial Bee Colony and Genetic Algorithms. The models can be created from scratch or they can use a template to start from, thus becoming an improvement on transfer learning.

An example of the evolution of one of such models, created from scratch and meant for the characterization of misalignment artifacts in CT volumes, is shown below:

DISCLAIMER: The Chimera Algorithm is still on its first developmental stages and most of it is hard-coded to work with an specific dataset. Although the code can be interesting to study, it is unusable unless access to the employed datasets is given, or heavy changes are performed to adapt the code to a new dataset.
